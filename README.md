Talk about your preferred development environment. (What IDE or text editor you enjoy, and why?)

  I like both Visual Studio Code and Webstorm. However, I gravitate more towards Jet Brains products.
I have developed in VS Code with Python, C++ and JS. I have alse used Pycharm, Clion, IntelliJ and Webstorm.
I feel that Jet Brains products come out of the box with more tools available therefor requiring less plugins.
All Jet Brains IDEs have a very powerful abiltiy to easily customize your themes within the IDE without downloading a plugin.
VS code allows you to do the same thing but it is much harder to do and less user friendly. I also prefer the autocomplete inside of Jet Brains products to 
those of VS code.
